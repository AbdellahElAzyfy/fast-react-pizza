# Fast React Pizza üçï

This project is a web application for a pizza restaurant, built as part of **Jonas Schmedtmann's React course**. It serves as the main project for the course, guiding you through the creation of a fully functional front-end application to teach the fundamentals of modern React development.

## üöÄ **Features**

- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Menu**: The home page displays a dynamic menu of pizzas, complete with details like names, ingredients, and prices.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add pizzas to a cart and view their selected items before placing an order.
- **Order Creation**: The application includes a form to submit a new order, with real-time feedback and validation.
- **Order Tracking**: After placing an order, users can look up their order status and details using a unique ID.
- **Functional Components**: The entire project is built with functional components and modern **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`), reflecting current best practices.
- **Client-Side Routing**: The app uses **React Router** to manage different views and navigation.
- **State Management**: It demonstrates robust state management using a combination of local component state and the `useReducer` hook for more complex, application-wide state.

## üìñ **Learning Outcomes**

This project was a comprehensive learning experience, covering key React concepts such as:

- **Component-based architecture**: Building a modular and reusable UI.
- **State management**: Effectively handling application data using `useState`, `useReducer`, and `Redux Toolkit`.
- **Conditional rendering**: Displaying different UI elements based on specific conditions (e.g., "sold out" items).
- **Client-side routing**: Managing navigation between different pages without a full page reload.
- **Data fetching**: Handling asynchronous API calls to load menu items and order data.
- **Styling in React**: Applying styles using a modern framework like Tailwind CSS.
- **Custom Hooks**: Abstracting reusable logic into custom hooks.
